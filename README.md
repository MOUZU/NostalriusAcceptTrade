# NostalriusAcceptTrade

Nostalrius implemented a feature on their servers to block the AcceptTrade button in a Trade window for 2seconds after an item or money has been modified.
This feature shall prevent scams.

<b>This AddOn</b> is adjusting the visual for this feature, meaning once a change in the Tradewindow has been done the 'AcceptTrade' button will grey out for 2 seconds until Nostalrius allows you to accept the trade.
<br>This should clear up any confusion while trying to accept a Trade.
